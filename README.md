## ![Stop Forum Spam Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maikuolan/SFS-Mass-IP-Checker/master/public/sfs.gif) **SFS Mass IP Checker**

A stand-alone script for checking IP addresses en-masse against the **[Stop Forum Spam](http://www.stopforumspam.com/)** database.

*NOTE: Repository doesn't yet contain any working code; This project is still in the pre-alpha planning stage, and I'm not yet certain whether I'll continue it or cancel it. If I cancel it, I'll drop this repo, but if I continue it, I'll likely be putting up working code within a few days.*

*Alternatively, I strongly recommend checking out __"[Gunner's Spam List Checker](http://www.gunnerinc.com/index.htm)"__ tool; This is a stand-alone tool that allows you both to submit and to check IPs against the Stop Forum Spam database en-masse.*
