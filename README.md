## ![Stop Forum Spam Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maikuolan/SFS-Mass-IP-Checker/master/public/sfs.gif) **SFS Mass IP Checker**

A stand-alone script for checking IP addresses en-masse against the **[Stop Forum Spam](http://www.stopforumspam.com/)** database.

*WARNING: This project is still in the ALPHA stage, and isn't yet ready for deployment! Use of this script acknowledges your consent to abide by the [SFS Acceptable Use Policy](http://www.stopforumspam.com/legal), and furthermore, that use of this script is done by your own behest and at your own risk! Because this is still in the ALPHA stage, expect imminent changes to occur.*

*Alternatively, I strongly recommend checking out __"[Gunner's Spam List Checker](http://www.gunnerinc.com/index.htm)"__ tool; This is a stand-alone tool that allows you both to submit and to check IPs against the Stop Forum Spam database en-masse.*
